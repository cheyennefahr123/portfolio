Cheyenne Fahr's Personal Website Project 
* Hosting link: https://cheyennefahr123.github.io/portfolio/
* This is a personal website to be further improved upon. It lays out basic contact information, experience and has an outline of where projects can be linked to on the projects tab.
* Any user can access the website from the homepage and navigate to the contact form (connected to formspree.io), projects and experience (resume) to learn more about future work/to review for future applications (i.e., for a manager/recruiter to review). Some functional components offered are reactive buttons and the form fields integreted with formspree.io. 
* HTML and CSS was used on this project. 
* Some future enhancements include: Utilizing javascript to make more conditional elements (i.e., carousel, different buttons etc). Customizing the cards on the projects page to match the theme of the website more and also linking the cards to future projects as they are currently not linked to anything. Making the experience tab more user friendly by adding a component that will allow the user to easily download a PDF version of resume.
